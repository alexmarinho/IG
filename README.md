# An Iterated Greedy Algorithm Applied in Scheduling with Rejection and Tardiness Penalties

All details of how the algorithm works are explained in the [wiki.](https://github.com/alexmarinho/IG/wiki)

### Requirements

This Metaheuristic was developed using [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) but it should also work with other Python installations as long as you have NumPy, Pandas, MatPlotLib and PyQt5 installed.

The versions used were:

* Python v3.6.2
* matplotlib v2.1.0
* numpy v1.13.3
* pandas v0.21.0
* PyQt5 v5.9.1

## Installation

Download and install Python v3.6 or above at [www.python.org.](www.python.org)

If you are using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) then you can install all required Python packages by running the following commands in a shell:

    conda create --name ig python=3
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
You can run the program by entering:

    python application.py

## IG Excel Version

The same algorithm was developed using Visual Basic in Microsoft Excel 32 bits, with superior performance.
To run it, just execute the file /IG EXCEL/IG.xlsm and enable the macros.
